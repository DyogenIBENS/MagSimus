Use myLightGenomes.LightGenome and myLightGenome.Families in MagSimus


1) Translate all files in libs/utils into english
2) Do not output ancGenes of extant species during simulations
3) Add licenses
4) log standard, verify the log of evolutive events
5) compute the N50 and the weighted mean for each genome of the simulation
6) write hypothesis when a chromosome is empty (no gene) it is removed but this 
may not be relevant biologicaly
7) tandemDupProp should be branch specific (see tandem dup prop in the
comparison of the Lizard with the Chicken)
8) explain the file format of geneTimeline
9) explain specRates format
10) explain each parameter of magSimusX
!!!11) may the true number chromosomal events be linked more to the number of
speciation events rather than the amount of time during which they evolved ?
(See the end of the discussion of ChromEvol)
12) coevolutionScore: au lieu de calculer s/n, calculer le score de coevolution 
comme s/(nb de branches de l'arbre).

13) dans le vecteur d'evenements, diff√©rencier les duplications disperses des duplications en tandem


Suggestion:
-----------------
* avoid to design chromosomes of less than 2 genes
* put all ancestral orientation to +1 to easily see gene inversions in sbs
* remove sexual chromosomes since they have a specific evolution (few
	translocation with other chromosomes and rather only inversions intra-chromosomique)
* Assess the relevance to avoid removing or deleting genes that appeared de
  novo along one lineage.
* Consider euploidy/dysploidy
* Why not using well assembled genomes ? And then breaking it and removing
  some genes to simulate wrongly assembled genomes.
* some scripts in src/analysis use our cluster interface based on the software
  condor. These scripts may use some specific absolute paths to scripts in bioclusts.
	It would be interesting to warn users of this.
* Sometimes the log of the simulation is very huge ~25Go whereas usually it is
  around ~100Mo. Solve this issue that may be caused by long tries to perform
	fusions when there are few chromosomes or by long loops during the clustering 
	of genes in the first ancestor.
